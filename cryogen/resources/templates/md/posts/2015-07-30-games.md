### Meet #5

# Minecraft

There was a demonstration of Dominic's [Bukkure](https://github.com/SevereOverfl0w/bukkure) plugin - a plugin that enables the development of Minecraft plugins using Clojure. Bukkure comes in two parts - a library that wraps the Java api to allow interfacing to the Minecraft server in a more idiomatic way and a plugin that allows you to connect a Clojure REPL to the server so you can interactively develop your plugins.

The demonstration largely involved using the Repl to create chickens and then blowing them up. We got up to 200 simultaneous chicken combustions before the conversation moved on.

# Lair

We had a demonstration of [Lair](https://github.com/danstone/lair) - a game in development by Dan Stone. Lair is a dungeon adventure game written in pure Clojure. Running through the code it was noted that the game was a great example of idiomatic Clojure code.

# Editors

This time the discussion on editors was brief. It was generally felt that Cursive was a good editor for those starting to learn Clojure.

# Learning Clojure

A tutorial on Clojure was provided for our newest member, Rachel. We are expecting her to produce a Quine in Clojure by the next meet.

We discussed which books were good to learn Clojure and came up with the following recommendations :

- [Clojure from the ground up](https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome)
- [Clojure for the brave and true](http://www.braveclojure.com/)
- [Clojure in Action](http://www.manning.com/rathore2/)

For a good intermediate book [Clojure Applied](https://pragprog.com/book/vmclojeco/clojure-applied) is still in prerelease, but looks promising.

And of course with a few beginner books under your belt, [The Joy of Clojure](http://www.manning.com/fogus2/) is essential.
