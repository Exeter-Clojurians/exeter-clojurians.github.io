### Meet #2

> A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".

We came up with the following masterpieces :

In Common Lisp, courtesy of hhdave :

```
(defun f ()
 (let ((quote (string (code-char 34))))
   (flet ((g (x)
            (str "(defun f () (let ((quote (string (code-char 34)))) (flet ((g (x) (str " x "))) (g (str quote (g (str quote (string (code-char 120))  quote)) quote))))) ")))
     (g (str quote (g (str quote (string (code-char 120)) quote )) quote)))))
```

In Clojure, courtesy of eggman :

```
(def quine
  (fn []
    ((fn [x] (list (quote fn) [] (list x (list (quote quote) x))))
      (quote (fn [x] (list (quote fn) [] (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))))
  )
```

Lots of fun was had.
