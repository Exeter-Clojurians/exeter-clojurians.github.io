To get started you will want make sure you have a JVM. Then install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).

Then you need to get a decent editor (never use notepad).  If you use Emacs you need to install [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) and [Paredit](http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html) otherwise [Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/) comes highly recommended . You can use Vim as well if you want - you will probably want to use [Fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace).

Then learn a bit of Clojure with [http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/) then [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/).

As you learn, solve a few [puzzles](https://www.4clojure.com/).

The best place to look up documentation is [Clojure docs](https://clojuredocs.org/). The [Cheat Sheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet) is also invaluable.

When you are ready to do some web dev, by far the easiest way is to use the [Chestnut](https://github.com/plexus/chestnut) template. This generates a project with client and server all set up and has all the plugins set up right so you have a repl to both the server and the browser – it can be quite frustrating trying to get it all set up by hand.

Here’s a list of some [libraries](https://github.com/razum2um/awesome-clojure) that you may find useful on your way.

Any questions come along to [our next meet](http://www.meetup.com/Exeter-Clojurians/)
