    <h3><a name="meet&#95;#3"></a>Meet #3</h3><p>Largely discussion based. A wide range of topics were covered.</p><h4><a name="transducers"></a>Transducers</h4><p>An excellent overview of the forthcoming transducers was provided courtesy of Dan Stone. The advantages of composition and efficiency due to not having to create intermediate collections were covered. Transducers were compared to .Net's Linq. In many ways they are similar - however .Net does have to rely on mutation within the Enumerator whereas Clojure does not.</p><p>A great follow up tutorial was provided : <a href='http://elbenshira.com/blog/understanding-transducers/'>http://elbenshira.com/blog/understanding-transducers/</a></p><h4><a name="component"></a>Component</h4><p>We discussed the Component library which was highly recommended for complex systems. There were some concerns raised by the Java devs that it was bringing back the days of Spring with it's massive lists of config settings. However, Component is different due to it config options being native Clojure data structures and there generally being less components in a Clojure system.</p><h4><a name="macros"></a>Macros</h4><p>Macros are used very rarely. They can cause numerous problems - you cannot apply a macro, it often obscures what is going on. Compojure (a macro based routing library) was compared to Bidi (a data structure based routing library). It was generally felt Bidi was much easier to work with.</p><h4><a name="editors"></a>Editors</h4><p>Inevitably some of the conversation turned to peoples preferred editors. Generally the group is split between Emacs and Cursive. Even the Emacs users admitted that Cursive is starting to look pretty interesting.</p><h4><a name="outsourcing"></a>Outsourcing</h4><p>We covered the foibles of working with Clojure in an organisation that heavily leverages outsourcing. Since Clojure is not as prevalant most outsourced work ends up being in Java.</p><h4><a name="professional&#95;development"></a>Professional development</h4><p>We discussed the advantages of maintaining a blog and github profile. Getting involved in open source projects is not always easy. First it can be difficult finding a decent project to contribute to. Then to make a decent contribution one always has to also include tests and documentation - which can be quite boring/intimidating to do. So often it is just easier to keep the code to yourself. However it was pointed out that any contribution is often valued. A great way to get started contributing is with documentation - from simple typo fixes to adding whole wiki pages. And there is always the exeter-clojurians.space site that could do with contributions!</p>
